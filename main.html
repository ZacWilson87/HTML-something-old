            <h1 id="meditation">Meditation</h1>&amp;
            <br>
            <p>I'm sure you've heard many times that the practice of meditation can be extremely beneficial! I personally, along
                with millions of other people through several millennia, have found this sentiment to be VERY true. If thats not enough, 
                scientific studies have shown that the bodies levels of Cortisol(hormone linked to stress) greatly reduce. <br> It, like many 
                other disciplines, takes great effort. How does sitting in one place take effort? Well, try to clear your head for 60 seconds 
                straight without having any thoughts take over again &amp; you'll see just what I mean! When thoughts do appear in meditation, 
                the practitioner notices them, lets them go till a later time, &amp; goes back to original mindset of a clear mind. &amp; if taming 
                the mind isnt hard enough, the discipline of making time to sit into a daily routine, is in itself a hard task to achieve. 
                <br> Personally, I've found that a space is widened between my thoughts &amp; me. I find that anger, sadness, &amp; anxiety 
                are all greatly reduced through consistency of practice. Scienti You become a viewer of your own thoughts, not enslaved or 
                tugged every which direction because of them. Mediation allowed me to become my own therapist &amp; has created a lasting sense 
                of awareness. My brain has literally been reprogrammed to react to different states of mind or stimuli in a whole new way. 
                In short, meditation has my approval, multitudes of other peoples approval, &amp; science's approval. If you would like to learn

            <h1 id="dhammapada">Dhammapada: An Aphoristic Teaching</h1>
            <br>
            <p>The Dhammapada is an ancient Pali text that all Buddhist sects recognize &amp; is one the better known Buddhist scriptures. Though many
                sects don't use it as one of their main teachings, it is still has the upmost of reverence &amp; is known as the original teachings
                of Siddartha Guatma(O.G. Buddha).
            </p>
            <p>While <b>aphorism</b> is defined as: <br><br> <li> A consise statement of a principle or truth</li>
                <li>A minimal terse formulation of a truth or sentiment (truth can be individual!)</li><br>
                Okay, I get it, the whole aphorism thing might not be so clear, so here is a literal example of an aphoristic teaching from the 
                Dhammapadda: <br>
                <p>“Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love; this is the eternal rule.”</p>
                OR <br>
                <p>“Conquer the angry one by not getting angry; conquer the wicked by goodness; conquer the 
                stingy by generosity, &amp; the liar by speaking the truth.</p>
                Finally, after the laman's explanation, I can get to the heart of why aphoristic teachings are so great. Because they are short, 
                they are easy to remember. They often allude the main point of the verse as similar to something we underst&amp; like: <em>'hatred is a 
                fire which burns all it touches.'</em>&nbsp; Because of this, the Dhammapada is highly relatable &amp; memorable. You could read the whole thing
                in one night, but spend your whole life dissecting &amp; applying the underst&amp;ings to your own experience. I found that this made
                underst&amp;ings of the text itself to be a very deep knowledge that can be applied all areas of life.

            <br>
            <p>BUDDHISM ISN'T A RELIGION!! BUDDHISM ISN'T A RELIGION!! BUDDHISM ISN'T A RELIGION!!</p><p> At least not in the western sense of the word, I personally love
                this aspect. When it comes to God(s) its left up to the practitioner to make their own decision as to what they believe, I mean it is 'YOUR' belief. The 
                principles &amp; guidelines the faith suggests have nothing to do with who or what diety you asscribe to, but rather a path on how to lead a better life,
                help others lead better live's, &amp; ultimately to transcend suffering.
