        <h1 class="headers">Meditation</h1>
        <p>I'm sure you've heard many times that the practice of meditation can be extremely beneficial! I personally, along
            with millions upon millions of other people, have found this sentiment to be VERY true. <br> It, like many
            other disciplines, takes great effort. How does sitting in one place take effort? Well, try to clear your head for 60 seconds straight
            without having any thoughts take over again and you'll see just what I mean! When thoughts do appear in meditation, the practitioner
            notices them, lets them go till a later time, and goes back to original mindset of a clear mind. Besides the mind being fickle thing,
            the discipline of making time to sit into a daily routine, is in itself a hard task to achieve. <br> Personally, I've found that 
            a space is widened between my thoughts and me. I find that anger, sadness, & anxiety are all greatly reduced through consistency of
            practice. You become a viewer of your own thoughts, not enslaved or tugged every which direction because of them. Mediation allowed
            me to become my own therapist and has created a lasting sense of mindfulness. My brain has literally been reprogrammed to react to
            different states of mind or stimuli in a whole new way. If you would like to learn more about Buddhist meditation visit

        <h1 class="headers">Dhammapada: An Aphoristic Teaching</h1>
        <p>The Dhammapada is a ancient Pali text that all Buddhist sects recognize and is one the better known Buddhist scriptures. Though many
            sects don't use it as one of their main teachings, it is still has the upmost of reverence and is known as the original teachings
            of Siddartha Guatma(O.G. Buddha).
        </p>
        <p>While <b>aphorism</b> is defined as:<li style='font-size: 14px'>A consise statement of a principle or truth</li>
            <li>A minimal terse formulation of a truth or sentiment (truth can be individual!)</li><br>
            Okay, I get it, the whole aphorism thing might not be so clear, so here is a literal example of an aphoristic teaching from the 
            Dhammapadda: <br>
            <p style="color: rgb(90, 146, 94); font-size: 18px;">“Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love; this is the eternal rule.”</p>
            OR <br>
            <p style="color: rgb(90, 146, 94); font-size: 18px;">“Conquer the angry one by not getting angry; conquer the wicked by goodness; conquer the 
            stingy by generosity, and the liar by speaking the truth.</p>
            Finally, after the lamans explanation, I can get to the heart of why aphoristic teachings are so great. Because they are short, 
            they are easy to remember. They often allude the main point of the verse is similar to something we understand like: <em>'hatred is a 
            fire which burns all it touches.'</em>  Because of this, the Dhammapada is highly relatable and memorable. You could read the whole thing
            in one night, but spend your whole life dissecting and applying the understandings to your own experience
