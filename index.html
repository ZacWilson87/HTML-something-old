        <h1 class="headers">Meditation</h1>
        <p>I'm sure you've heard many times that the practice of meditation can be extremely beneficial! I personally, along
            with millions of other people through several millennia, have found this sentiment to be VERY true. If thats not enough, 
            scientific studies have shown that the bodies levels of Cortisol(hormone linked to stress) greatly reduce. <br> It, like many 
            other disciplines, takes great effort. How does sitting in one place take effort? Well, try to clear your head for 60 seconds 
            straight without having any thoughts take over again and you'll see just what I mean! When thoughts do appear in meditation, 
            the practitioner notices them, lets them go till a later time, and goes back to original mindset of a clear mind. And if taming 
            the mind isnt hard enough, the discipline of making time to sit into a daily routine, is in itself a hard task to achieve. 
            <br> Personally, I've found that a space is widened between my thoughts and me. I find that anger, sadness, &amp; anxiety 
            are all greatly reduced through consistency of practice. Scienti You become a viewer of your own thoughts, not enslaved or 
            tugged every which direction because of them. Mediation allowed me to become my own therapist and has created a lasting sense 
            of awareness. My brain has literally been reprogrammed to react to different states of mind or stimuli in a whole new way. 
            In short, meditation has my approval, multitudes of other peoples approval, and science's approval. If you would like to learn

        <h1 class="headers">Dhammapada: An Aphoristic Teaching</h1>
        <p>The Dhammapada is an ancient Pali text that all Buddhist sects recognize and is one the better known Buddhist scriptures. Though many
            sects don't use it as one of their main teachings, it is still has the upmost of reverence and is known as the original teachings
            of Siddartha Guatma(O.G. Buddha).
        </p>
        <p>While <b>aphorism</b> is defined as:<li style='font-size: 14px'>A consise statement of a principle or truth</li>
            <li>A minimal terse formulation of a truth or sentiment (truth can be individual!)</li><br>
            Okay, I get it, the whole aphorism thing might not be so clear, so here is a literal example of an aphoristic teaching from the 
            Dhammapadda: <br>
            <p style="color: #58b4d1; font-size: 18px;">“Hatred does not cease by hatred, but only by love; this is the eternal rule.”</p>
            OR <br>
            <p style="color: #58b4d1; font-size: 18px;">“Conquer the angry one by not getting angry; conquer the wicked by goodness; conquer the 
            stingy by generosity, and the liar by speaking the truth.</p>
            Finally, after the laman's explanation, I can get to the heart of why aphoristic teachings are so great. Because they are short, 
            they are easy to remember. They often allude the main point of the verse as similar to something we understand like: <em>'hatred is a 
            fire which burns all it touches.'</em>&nbsp; Because of this, the Dhammapada is highly relatable and memorable. You could read the whole thing
            in one night, but spend your whole life dissecting and applying the understandings to your own experience. I found that this made
            understandings of the text itself to be a very deep knowledge that can be applied all areas of life.

        <h1 class="headers">Spirituality Without Theism</h1>
        <p style="color: #58b4d1;">BUDDHISM ISN'T A RELIGION!! BUDDHISM ISN'T A RELIGION!! BUDDHISM ISN'T A RELIGION!!</p><p> At least not in the western sense of the word, I personally love
        this aspect. When it comes to God(s) its left up to the practitioner to make their own decision as to what they believe, I mean it is 'YOUR' belief. The 
        principles and guidelines the faith suggests have nothing to do with who or what diety you asscribe to, but rather a path on how to lead a better life,
        help others lead better live's, and ultimately to transcend suffering.  </p>
